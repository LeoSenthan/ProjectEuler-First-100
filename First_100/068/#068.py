#2*sum of inside = sum of outside
# since it is 16 digit string 10 has to be on outside
#Hence total of rows has to be either 13 or 14
#Hence bigger numbers outside and smaller numbers inside hence it can not be 13 since one row has to be 10 1 and 2
#and if this was the case one of the bigger numbers would have to be on the inside
#Pen and paper with total row length 14 which means one row is either 10 1 3 or 10 3 1
